    "Goal of this step is to provide EO payload sizing rough order of magnitude (RoM) sizing relations to addressed two main questions:\n",
    "- Can we \"see/distinguish\" the phenomenon/thing of interest? Which is answered by the EO resolution metrics\n",
    "- Can we download the data on time? Which is to be answered with the input of orbital simulation yielding contact times with ground segment (ground stations) and the data generation as a function or orbit over area of interest (AoI) at nadir times a data rate (part two of this code)\n",

    "This is done to size the payload spatial resolution based on analogy to other missions and provide initial values for the mission analysis by constraining the \"physically\" feasible values (i.e. the finer spatial resolution achievable given the boundary/constrains of the CubeSat).\n",

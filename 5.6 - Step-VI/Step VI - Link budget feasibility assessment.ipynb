    "To assess the link budget, both in terms of payload data generated and in terms of download capability (in time), an orbital simulation of the satellites, ground segment and area of interest is required. In this section some of those scenarios are presented, to indicate the though process). Each simulation was ran for 30 days starting January 1st, 2025, it took 90-100 minutes to complete.\n",

To remove the short connections between the satellites and the ground stations, a filter is implemented towards the data obtained such as links are only valid if they are five minutes long or more. The later graphs represent the total amount of data produced daily by the cluster when passing the area, the total amount of data available to download by the ground stations and finally the total amount of link time per day on each ground station of all satellites."

    "\n",
    "The Field of View (FOV) corresponds to the solid angle through which a detector element (a pixel sensor) is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation at any one time. In that case is called instantaneous field of view or IFOV. A measure of the spatial resolution of a remote sensing imaging system, it is often expressed as dimensions of visible ground area, for some known sensor altitude. For this analysis scenario it is established that the view of the satellite will not be based on a cone but rather a rectangle, using the CAM sensor used by the KITSUNE 6U spacecraft (BIN AZAMI et al., 2021) . After that, the swath width can be estimated.\n",
    "We begin by the spatial resolutions provided previously $R_{GSD}$. With this information you can estimate the swath width by multiplying it with sizes of $6464\\times\\ 4852\\ [px]$ based on Kitsune (AZAMI et al., 2022b). Then, based on the sizing relationships by (WERTZ; EVERETT; PUSCHELL, 2011a), you can calculate the half angles of the FOV of the sensor pointing nadir with Eq. 5-6, Eq. 5-7 and Eq. 5-8 where the variables are represented in Figure 5-12 with $\\alpha_a$,$\\ \\alpha_b$ are the angles corresponding the width and height measured from the center lines respectively, $x_a$,$\\ x_b$ are the half width and half height of the sensor respectively.\n",

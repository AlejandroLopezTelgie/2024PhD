    "At this this stage, given the area of interest, both orbits do provide coverage (the final one is to be assessed based on orbital analysis and mission lifetime). SSO being higher do present an advantage in orbital lifetime and coverage.\n",
    "Regarding launch opportunities, literature and launch providers suggest a minimum lead time in the order of 6 months for a brokered POD launch while SpaceX has a lead time in the order of 24 months. This is particularly relevant to 2nd generation, as the mission is required to be operational in 3 years (Req 3.14 schedule).\n",
    "As for price, Spaceflight is the only broker which had available prices, see Table 2 7 for further details. In summary the order is 100 kUSD for 1U and 150 kUSD for a 3U. \n",
    "No orbit manoeuvring (raising) capabilities are considered at this stage, as the current technology readiness level of propulsion for CubeSat is not regarded as mature enough nor able to raise significantly with respect to the orbit where it is deployed by the launch vehicle (Yet several companies, like D-Orbit, and subsystems are currently developing these capabilities. Hence this must be re visit at the time of running the algorithm/heuristic).\n",

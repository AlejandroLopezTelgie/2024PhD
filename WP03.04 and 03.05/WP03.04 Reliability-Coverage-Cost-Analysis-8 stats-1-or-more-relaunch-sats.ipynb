It is done by setting the inputs of the several scenarios that makes up the DSM and outputs a summary table and a graph that plots the reliability curves of such systems. Unlike the conclusions established by Bouwmeester et al. [2022] on how to attack the reliability problem of CubeSat, which is the improvement of pre-launch tests; this work will delve into another option to improve it, which is to release more elements periodically. Considering this and everything mentioned above is that a new architecture is presented, detailed in its operation and purpose, that incorporates design and mission considerations as well as its limitations.

It is important to remark the fact that, although the fit at t = 0 the reliability given is 1, in reality it's not always the case. There is a process of setting up the satellite, that takes about a week as an estimation, that could then show infant mortalities and the death of the satellite. Considering as well that the time steps are between months, a small shift in time is added so that both the relaunch and the beginning of the mission doesn't begin with 100% reliability, but less. Thus the reliaility at a month T is actually month T + 1 week, being this week the booting and setting week. "

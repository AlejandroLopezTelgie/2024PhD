    "The AoI for this study comes from the guidelines given by the Classic FireSat Space Mission, which aims to detect, identify, monitor and report fires in Brazilian territory in almost real-time and at low cost. As part of the INPE Burning and Forest Fire Monitoring Program (INPE, 2023), there is a detailed study of Fire Risk. This study takes into account aspects such as precipitation, effects of the type of vegetation and the natural cycle of its defoliation, the maximum temperature and minimum relative humidity of the daily air. In order to define the areas of interes, the same methodology used by (Generoso et al., 2021) is applied. Four pictures are selected, each one per season and areas are compared.\n",

In addition, it is a region made up of several biomes such as the caatinga (predominantly), cerrado, Atlantic forest and the Amazon forest.\n",
